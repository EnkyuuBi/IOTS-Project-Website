# IOTS Project Website
 Front and Backend for IOTS Project Website
# Deploying
Both the front end and backend are intended to be deployed on the same machine
Deploying the front end:
- cd into the FrontEnd\my-app folder
- run "npm run dev"
A notif should pop up with the server runnning on a localhost

Deploying the Backend:
- cd into the Server folder
- run "node https.js"
a notif should pop up with the port number, access localhost:<port number> for the app. The backend is a pure api so you'll only get json data.
